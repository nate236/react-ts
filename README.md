# Module 13 Challenge: Candidate Search

![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
# Description
For this project, I completed a candidate search application that integrates with the GitHub API to fetch and display developer profiles in the browser.

The application's API, which retrieves data from GitHub, was already set up. My task involved:

Building the front end using TypeScript and React
Calling the applicationâ€™s API to fetch and display candidate data
Deploying the full application to Render for production use
This implementation ensures a type-safe, efficient, and scalable solution for searching and reviewing GitHub users.
